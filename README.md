# RSSI-Measurement-Openwrt
A bot in Linux for reading and showing the RSSI value of any alpha tube(transmitter) by other alpha tube(receiver).
In this code an alpha tube of IP Address 192.168.1.XXX is a transmitter and we are able to read the strength of the signal of this alphatube which is RSSI(received signal strength indicator).
one can also edit for multi alphatubes by adding their IP address and adding simple select function.
